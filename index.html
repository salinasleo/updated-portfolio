        My 7 yr old boy likes videogames and wants me to build games for him. I told him it takes teams to build the apps he's addicted
        to, but here I am anyway giving it a shot. I enrolled into a coding bootcamp at the University of Richmond. I took
        every creative liberty we had in our assignments to try to build something he would hopefully enjoy!
        <br></br>

        <ul>
          <li>As part of the program prework I built him a game in
            <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/217955888/"> Scratch</a> where a cat kills bats. He loved that the cat shot an image of him as weapon, but suggested I change
            the enemy from bats to mice so I showed him how to do that. I also had to change the difficulty level because
            he got frustrated by fast moving mice!</li>
          <li>For a Javascript assignment I built this
            <a href="https://salinasleo.github.io/unit-4-game/">Jelly Bean Collector Game!</a> He did enjoy that for a little while, since he loves adding numbers in his head.</li>
          <li>As part of the Firebase homework I built a
            <a href="https://salinasleo.github.io/RPSLS-Multiplayer/"> Rock Paper Scissors Spock </a> multiplayer game for him and we played it simultaneously on different laptops.
            It was great to learn about cloud databases.</li>
          <li>For a React assignment, I built him a
            <a href="https://salinasleo.github.io/clickyreact/">" Yu Gi Oh Themed Memory Game. </a>To me all the characters look the same, but he names them as he's clicking
            them and quickly got to the maximum score of 12. I then increased the images to 18 and he got 18 almost
            right away. Then I increased it to 24 and he got to 22 of 24 before his attention turned elsewhere. I was so
            glad when he asked to play the game again the next day :)
          </li>
        </ul>


        This site itself is an assignment in the use of html, css, and javascript (I tried to get his attention by adding hover or click actions to my profile picture).
        <br>
        <br> Before the bootcamp I created an e-commerce website using Volusion.com for a
        <a href="http://www.poppedamaranth.com">business</a> I started in 2017. I intend to copy it locally and build on it, for example I want to add the ability
        to accept cryptocurrency as payment.
        <br>
        <br> For my dayjob I perform analytics for
        <a href="http://www.suntrust.com">SunTrust Bank</a>, and since 2008 I have been analyzing and summarizing our loan performance, default operations, fraud
        operations, and customer satisfaction. Feel free to check out and connect with me on
        <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/leo-salinas-67b541a">LinkedIn</a>.
        <br>
        <br> I am a former competitive swimmer, I represented my home county of Mexico at the highest levels. Watch me here in
